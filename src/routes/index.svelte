<p>Here's my attempt at this year's advent of code challenges. I'm building it all in SvelteKit in hopes to do more than just post the answers once I get a little more time to touch them up a bit. ðŸ˜›</p>

<p>You can find the code for each challenge in the <code>src > routes > days</code> directory.</p>

<style>
  code {
    color: var(--sea-foam)
  }
</style>
